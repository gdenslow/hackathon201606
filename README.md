# hackathon201606

for this hackathon, i wanted to get my feet wet with python and go.

i believe i've tweaked some existing python code here RP, but i'd never
created any code from scratch.  i've never written any go code.

---

i started with a small perl script which will

    * obtain a file list from a dir
    * open each file
    * apply a regular expression to lines in the file to extract data
    * output the parsed data

and then i created a python version and a go version.

i tested that they all produce the same results.

what's to come?  do more python and go.
